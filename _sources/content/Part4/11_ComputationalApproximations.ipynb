    "## Markov chain Monte Carlo, MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many models, like hierarchical models, in which not the grid approximation nor the quadratic approximation are satisfactory. The first one, because usually there are many parameters in a hierarchical model. The second one, because hyperparameters might not be well-approximated through a normal distribution. As a result, non-intuitive techniques have been developed. Examples of these techniques include Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference, being MCMC the most popular one. In fact, it is widely recognized that, Bayesian statistics resurrected in the 1990s thanks to MCMC. Even while MCMC is older than 1990, the required computational power is not, thus the current success of Bayesin analysis is also a success of the computational engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using advanced techniques to approximate the posterior, like MCMC or variational inference, is that we scape from the odd assumption of a normal multivariate for the joint posterior. This is extremely useful for complex models like hierarchical models, in which the posterior is not well-approximated by a normal distribution. However, it exists a conceptual challenge since these techniques follow a non-obvious strategy. Simulation through Markov chains include many techniques. In these methods, the sample values for the parameters are obtained from distributions that approximate the posterior better at every step, which depend from the last sample (that is why they are Markov chains).\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical details about these methods correspond to a course of statistical computing and stochastic simulation. However, to gain some intuition, I like to think about these techniques as the Mexican piñatas. A piñata is a container, often made of cardboard, that is decorated and filled with candies. In the Mexican tradition, each participant will have a turn at hitting the piñata, which is hung from above on a string. The participant is blindfolded, given a wooden stick, and then spun a number of times, which makes the participant to feel dizzy and disoriented, having erratic movements. As the participants works to hit the piñata, another moves it to make it harder to hit. Similarly, our Markov chains are dizzy and disoriented, making random walks while trying to hit the posterior distribution. As participants in a piñata are guided by the spectators who say where the piñata is, our Markov chain is guided by a transition distribution, the likelihood and the prior who say where the posterior is.\n",
