    "Each edge in the graph can be either directed (marked by a single arrowhead on the egde) or undirected (unmarked links). If all edges are directed, we then have a directed graph. Directed graphs may include directed cycles (e.g. $X\\rightarrow Y$, $Y\\rightarrow X$).\n",

    "\n",
    "The 426 BC Malian Gulf tsunami was caused by one of a series of earthquakes which affected the course of the Peloponnesian War. It devastated the coasts of the Malian and Euboean Gulfs, Greece, in the summer of 426 BC. Thucydides inquired into its causes, and concluded that the tsunami must have been caused by an earthquake. He was thus historically the first known to correctly interpret the cause of a tsunami as a preceding geological event.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "About the same time that these earthquakes were so common, the sea at Orobiae, in Euboea, retiring from the then line of coast, returned in a huge wave and invaded a great part of the town, and retreated leaving some of it still under water; so that what was once land is now sea; such of the inhabitants perishing as could not run up to the higher ground in time.... The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. **Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen**.\n",
    "```\n",

    "## The ladder of causation\n",

    "We can distinguish three \"levels\" of causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  At the most basic level is **association**, which corresponds to the activity of **seeing**. Seeing or observing, entails detection of regularities in our environment and is shared by many animals as well as early humans before the Cognitive Revolution. At this level, we merely observe that a set of variables are statistically related.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second is the **intervention** level. The activity of **doing** corresponds to this level. Doing, entails predicting the effect(s) of deliberate alterations of the environment and choosing among these alterations to produce a desired outcome. Only a small handful of species have demonstrated elements of this skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At the highest level are **counterfactuals**, which correspond to the activity of **imaginig**. Imagining and causal relations is almost self-evident. It is useless to ask for the causes of things unless you can imagine their consequences.\n",

    "The idea of causes and effects is much more fundamental than the idea of probability. We begin learning causes and effects before we understand language and before we know any mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the meaning of \"cause\" has been the focus of a long tradition of philosophers, they have tried to define causation in terms of probability, using the notion of \"probability raising\": $X$ causes $Y$ if $X$ raises the probability of $Y$. But this increase may come about for other reasons, including $Y$ being a cause of $X$ or some other variable, $Z$, being the cause of both of them. That’s the catch!\n",
    "\n",
    "The proper way to rescue the probability-raising idea is with the do-operator. While $\\mathbb{P}(Y|X=x)$ denotes the observational distribution, which corresponds of seeing, $\\mathbb{P}(Y|\\text{do}(X=x))$ corresponds to the interventional distribution, which corresponds to the process of doing. Thus $\\mathbb{P}(Y|\\text{do}(X=x))$ describes the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$, which can be calculated using causal Bayesian networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making an event happen means that you emancipate it from all other influences. Thus we erase all the arrows leading into the intervened variable, set that variable manually to its prescribed value and continue the analysis by ordinary logic. This is because after *doing* the intervention all that is left for us to do is to *see* its effect.\n",
    "\n",

The question here is to what extent energy content of milk, measured here by kilocalories, is related to the percentage of brain mass that is neocortex. We'll end up needing female body mass as well.

This phenomenon might happen when one of the variable has a positive effect, while the other has a negative effect."
