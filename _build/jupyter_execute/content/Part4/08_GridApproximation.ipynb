To get a good approximation of the posterior we need two conditions, the first one is that we need a thin grid, the second one is that we need to get a large sample from this grid."

    "\n",
    "The Bayesian estimator consists of the whole posterior distribution. However, somtimes we need to report a punctual value of the parameters. In this case is common to report the MAP. Unfortunately, this estimator might arrise absurd results. For example **I need to add the example of estimating the proportion of water on the Earth surface.** Thus, instead of reporting the MAP other popular options are the posterior mean and the posterior median. Another option is to define a loss function and find the estimator that minimizes it. For instance, the mean minimizes the quadratic loss, while the median minimizes the absolute loss."
